## 🔍 Audit Checklist

### 1. ✅ Sensitive Files Check

**What was checked**:
- Environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- API keys and tokens
- Private keys and certificates
- Database credentials
- OAuth secrets

**Results**:
- ✅ No .env files committed (only .env.example templates)
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys found
- ✅ No private keys or certificates
- ✅ No database credentials in code
- ✅ All credentials use environment variables

**Files verified**:
- `.env` - Properly ignored ✅
- `ai-worker/.env` - Properly ignored ✅
- `.env.example` - Included as template ✅
- `ai-worker/.env.example` - Included as template ✅

---

### 2. ✅ Credentials in Source Code

**What was checked**:
- Hardcoded passwords
- API keys in comments
- Bearer tokens
- Database connection strings
- OAuth credentials

**Results**:
- ✅ All credentials use `process.env` or `os.getenv()`
- ✅ No credentials in comments
- ✅ No example credentials with real values
- ✅ All sensitive data properly abstracted

**Example patterns found** (all correct):
```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Using environment variables
const token = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
const googleClientId = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;

// ✅ Correct - Using os.getenv in Python
database_url = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
redis_url = os.getenv('REDIS_URL')
```
